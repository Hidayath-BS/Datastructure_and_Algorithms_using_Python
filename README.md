# Datastructure_and_Algorithms_using_Pythhon

**Data Structure:- A data Structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.**

**Following are the Data Structure**
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Deques



**Algorithm:- A set of steps or istruction for completing a task.**

**Hints:-**
- Clearly definned problem statement, input and output.
- The steps i Algorithm need to be very specific order.
- Steps also need distinct.
- Algorithm should produce a result.
- Algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time.
- correctness and efficiency (time complexity and space complexity).

**Following are 25 major Algorithm for fresher and experienced persons**

**Basics**
- Huffman coding compression Algo
